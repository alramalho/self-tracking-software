# Repo notes

- this repo uses turbo json for monorepo
- this repo uses pnpm
- this repo uses typescript
- the app frontend is available in apps/frontend-vite and uses vite
    - this app is the basis for both a PWA and a CapacitorJS-Native application, so when developing features we must be thoughtful that they support both scenarios.
- the apps/backend-node (main backend) uses express
- **apps/frontend is deprecated, and should never be changed** if I mention any frontend file, verify first whether this was not a mistake (likely it was).
