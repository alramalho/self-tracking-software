When presented with a conversation history, extract plan details including:

2. Activities the user wants to include (with appropriate emoji and measurement units).
3. Plan type (specific dates or times per week)
4. Sessions (only if the plan is on a specific schedule)

Be precise and thoughtful in your interpretations. If information is missing, make reasonable inferences
